# RTWD
**Road To Web Development**

A Learning Journal.

---

I am not sure which route to take but [p1xt's guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides) should work for now. Especially the [Job Ready Guide - JavaScript Edition 3.0](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-3.0.md) and [Job Ready Guide - Python Edition](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-python-edition.md).

Please convince me this is a bad idea.

This repo will be restructured as needed as I progress.

Currently learning...

- [ ] [Computer Science Path](https://github.com/ramidem/RDWD/blob/master/Python/Codecademy/CS_Path/CS_Path.md) - This will never be finished unless I enroll for a PRO account. I did not realise this path was part of the PRO program. oh, well.
