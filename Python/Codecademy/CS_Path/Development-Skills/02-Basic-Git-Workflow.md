# Hello Git
Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project
over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing
those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

## `git init`
This command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to a
project.

**Git Workflow**
Nice! We have a Git project. A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:

- A _Working Directory_: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
- A _Staging Area_: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory
- A _Repository_: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project

The Git workflow consists of editing files in the _working directory_, adding files to the _staging area_, and saving changes to a Git _repository_. In Git, we save changes with a commit.

---

## `git status`
Show the working tree status.

## `git add`
Add a file to the staging area.

## `git diff`
Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc

## `git commit`
Record changes to the repository.

Standard Conventions for Commit Messages:

- Must be in quotation marks
- Written in the present tense
- Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using -m

## `git log`
Show commit logs.
